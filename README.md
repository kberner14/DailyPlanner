    Daily Planner
    
I set out with a goal in mind of making a functioning daily planner that would break down what I was to be doing with my day hour by hour. The main idea being, the user could enter an activity or thought, have it saved, and return to it later. Some fun functionality was brought to it with the idea that it should be color coded based on the time of day.

Depending on the time of day, gathered from moment, it could be displayed and highlighted which part of the day you currently are at, which parts had past, and which you had to look forward to. This was an interesting introduction to using outside APIs to gather current global information, process it in a meaningful way, and use its substance in responsive way in a webpage.

In addition to API work, this page uses local storage to log information and allows for them to return to see this later on. The information was pulled from local storage using JSON formatting, processed, and placed using class and id splitting. It was interesting using new organizational techinques for data and seems like it could be a powerful tool for dealing with larger objects moving forward.

In the future, I plan to finish the overall functionality of this page, create a slightly more aesthetically pleasing layout, and, time permitting, add some mildly entertaining confirmation reactions for when entries occur.

If I find myself being overly ambitious, I'd like to figure out how to create a way to have the time slots automatically reset themselves after every day, and after that figure out how to enter certain repeatable "daily habits" that don't reset every day.
